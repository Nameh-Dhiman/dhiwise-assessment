## Steps to run the code
#### Note: Running backend first is important to get the api up and running to fetch the data on frontend.
### Backend
* First install the node modules required for the backend using npm install or npm i in the command line.
* To run the backend, use "node index.js" command after going inside the backend directory, on the command line or use nodemon by using command "npm run dev".
* Command line would show "Server Listening on port" the port which the backedn is running and "Connected to DB" if the backend was able to establish the connection with Mongo DB Atlas Successfully.

### Frontend
* First install the node modules required for the frontend using npm install or npm i in the command line.
* To run the frontend, use "npm run start" command after going inside the frontend directory, on the command line.


## Status
* Was able to create the API in the backend to serve the tree structure nested data.
* Was able to fetch it on the frontend and map the data to respective components.
* Was able to hide table data on hover.
* Wasn't able to complete editing the string data in table, but could have done it if more time was allowed.
